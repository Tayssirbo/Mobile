# Mobile

in this repository there are several projects that we have carried out during this semester in the course "mobile development"

TP1 : BasicLayoutsCodelab

In this codelab we implemented a  realistic and complex layout and we learned about various out of the box composables and modifiers along the way. 
I used the same template/Composables provided in the workshop to build an app for a restaurant :

TP2 : BasicStateCodelab
In this codelab we learned how the app's state determines what is displayed in the UI, how Compose keeps the UI updated when state changes, how to optimize the structure of your composable functions, and work with ViewModels in a Compose app.

I used the same template/Composables provided in the workshop to build a simple books app (where we can check the chapters we read):

In this codelab we learned how to navigate through the app and access desired pages.

Tp4 :ThemingCodelab

In this codelab we learned how to use Jetpack Compose's theming APIs to style your application. We learned how to customize colors, shapes and typography so that they're used consistently throughout your application and supporting light & dark theme and dynamic theming.

Tp5 : AdaptiveUICodelab

In this codelab we learned how to build adaptive apps for phones, tablets, and foldables, and how they enhance reachability with Jetpack Compose. WE also learned best practices for using Material 3 components and theming.
